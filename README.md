Welcome to my JSON File Reader application.

This project was built using React + Vite in order to render in the necassary JSON files with an Axios AJAX call.

Getting Started:

1. Please ensure that you have Node.js installed on your local machine in order to be able to run the commands needed for the package installations.

Installation Instructions:

1. Navigate to the projects file directory in your terminal after you have pulled this repo onto your local machine.

2. Run the command "npm install" in order to install all packages.

3. Once all the packages have been installed, run "npm run dev" in the terminal in order to start the application.

4. The application starts on your default port, in most cases this is "http://localhost:3000/". However, if you are unable to access it on port 3000, you are notified in the terminal after you run the "npm run dev" command.
